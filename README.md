# Supply Chain Performance Intelligence

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship.

The goal of this project is to perform an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset and transform raw operational data into actionable business insights.

The analysis explores sales performance, profitability, customer demand patterns, delivery performance, and operational efficiency. In addition, an interactive Business Intelligence dashboard was built using Streamlit and Plotly to help users explore the data dynamically.

## Business Problem

Supply chain organizations generate large amounts of operational data every day. However, without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to identify:

* High-performing markets
* Profitable product categories
* Seasonal demand patterns
* Delivery performance issues
* Profitability risks
* Operational bottlenecks

This project aims to convert raw supply chain data into meaningful insights that can support business decision-making.

✔ Explore the dataset structure and data quality

✔ Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies

✔ Test business assumptions using statistical analysis

✔ Detect operational issues affecting profitability

✔ Generate actionable business recommendations

✔ Build an interactive dashboard for decision-makers
